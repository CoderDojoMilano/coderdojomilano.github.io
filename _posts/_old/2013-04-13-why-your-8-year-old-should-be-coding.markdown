<blockquote> "Syntax is not important, it’s something you pick up. If you look at algorithms and write in pseudo-language, that’s a logical language. And it forces them to think in terms of solving problems, worrying about how to write it. And over time, they learn to translate into syntax, as well, slowly migrating in PHP or Python or what have you." - Krishna Vedati ([Tynker founder](//www.tynker.com/))</blockquote>
